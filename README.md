# MLRAgent
Java based agent to determine the Regression Model for a Multiple Linear Regression using a Normal Equation approach.

The project consists of an Agent that calculates the regression model of a hardcoded data set.
The NormalEcuationMLR class contains the data set and the Vector and Matrix operations for the Normal Equation.
The Agent class runs a OneShotBehaviour with a NormalEcuation object that calculates and show the reggresion model and a prediction of the given values.
The agent uses a InputDiologBox to recieve the given values.
